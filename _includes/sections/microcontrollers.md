    * Pi Pico
      * This micro controller was created by the Raspberry Pi foundation, so it means that buying one supports them instead of random companies cloning Arduinos. They are considerably more powerful than any of the other supported Arduinos. The Pi Pico supports a few extra features, such as USB Input (which allows for XB1 / Series compatability), support for unmodded Xbox 360 consoles, peripheral microcontrollers, and the Guitar Hero World Tour tap bar. Note that the Pi Pico runs at 3.3v, so it can just be used as is for PS2 and Wii adapters. Raspberry Pi Picos also tend to be the cheapest option with availability at local shops. With the currrent firmware, Raspberry Pi Picos work much much better than Arduinos and have more functionality. If your goal is to create adaptors, but they also work better for direct wiring too. This includes the Raspberry Pi Pico 2, RP2040 based boards, and RP2350 based boards.
    * Sparkfun Pro Micro (5v)
      * The 5V Pro Micro will work fine for direct wiring, but being that it runs at 5V, it will require voltage conversion to build Wii adapters and PS2 adapters and turntables.
    * Sparkfun Pro Micro (3.3v)
      * If you want to build an adapter for a Wii or PS2 guitar, this will be easier to use than any of the 5V microcontrollers. Due to the lower voltage, these do run at half the speed of the 5v variants, a. Clones of the Pro Micro are quite cheap but will need to be purchased from eBay or AliExpress, real Pro Micros are expensive, but there isn't much of a difference. 3.3V arduinos will poll a Wii guitar slightly slower than a 5V Arduino but in practice this doesn't end up being important as there are a lot of other delays involved when communicating with a Wii guitar.
    * Arduino Micro
      * This is essentially the same thing as a Pro Micro 5V, except that it is officially made by Arduino. This causes it to be more expensive compared to a Raspberry Pi Pico.
    * Arduino Leonardo
      * The Arduino Leonardo is essentially a 5V Pro Micro, except it has the layout of an Arduino Uno. You can find clones of these, but they are still more expensive then a Pro Micro or a Raspberry Pi Pico.
    * Arduino Uno (r1/r2/r3)
      * The Arduino R1, R2, and R3 controllers are actually two microcontrollers in one, and they work in tandem to provide a working controller. This has its disadvantages, as code needs to keep these controllers in sync, and this can result in issues if a bad configuration is programmed, and generally results in requiring more complicated and optimised code to work. Unos do still get 1000hz, but if you are buying a new microcontroller, we recommend against purchasing them. Note that some clone Arduino Unos are actually missing the second microcontroller, and these ones will NOT work at all. If you see an Arduino Uno listing that mentions "ch340g" or something similar, do not purchase it. Due to this, they are harder to purchase and since they require more parts, they are more expensive than a Pro Micro or Pi Pico.
    * Arduino Mega 2560
      * These are in the same situation as the Uno, however the main microcontroller has a lot more pins. They also end up being more expensive due to the amount of parts that are needed to make one.
    * Arduino Uno R4
      * This is the latest entry to the Arduino Uno line of products. The Arduino Uno R4 is unsupported due to using a different microcontroller.
    * Arduino Mini or Nano or Pro Mini or Pro Nano
      * These do NOT work, as they are essentially Unos that lack the second micro controller that allow for custom USB device emulation.
    * ESP32
      * Currently this is not supported due to the base ESP32 not fully supporting USB. There are some ESP32 models that have USB support, but these end up being more expensive than the Pi Pico, and thus it does not make sense to support these.

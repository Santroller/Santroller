# Authentication controllers
Some consoles check if a controller is a genuine controller. Our controllers are unoffical, so we need to trick the console into thinking our controller is genuine.

There are currently two ways to trick the console
1. Pass the check to an offical controller, by plugging a genuine controller into your Pi Pico. (This method only works on the Pi Pico)
2. Mod the console. There is a patch for the Xbox 360 that removes the authentication check.

## Consoles needing authentication
- Xbox 360, although this can be patched out using [UsbdSecPatch](#usbdsecpatch) on RGH or JTAG modded consoles.
- Xbox One and Series S|X
- PS4 / PS5, but only if you are not playing Rock Band 4. For Rock Band 4, you can use PS3 mode. If you are playing games besides Rock Band 4, you will need an authentication controller or dongle.

## Passing authentication checks to a legitimate controller
You can follow the [USB Inputs](https://santroller.tangentmc.net/wiring_guides/usb.html) guide. When USB Inputs are enabled, authentication checks will automatically be passed to a controller.

## Supported controllers
Xbox 360: most wired controllers should work.

Xbox One / Series S|X: The Xbox One or Series gamepads will work here, third party controllers do not. 

PS4: DualShock 4 works, most other controllers should work too.

PS5: A "typed" controller is needed. A GHLive dongle or a [MAGPS4](https://www.mayflash.com/product/MAGPS4.html) should work for this, or a PS4 drumkit, guitar, wheel or fight stick. A Dualshock 4 or Dualsense will NOT work here.

## Xbox 360 RGH
You can use [UsbdSecPatch](https://github.com/InvoxiPlayGames/UsbdSecPatch/releases) module to patch out the authentication checks on an RGH modded console.

### Instructions:
1. Mod your console and install [DashLaunch](https://consolemods.org/wiki/File:DashLaunch_v3.21.7z)
2. Copy the .xex file you downloaded to your Xbox 360.
3. Add [UsbdSecPatch](https://github.com/InvoxiPlayGames/UsbdSecPatch/releases) to your [DashLaunch](https://consolemods.org/wiki/File:DashLaunch_v3.21.7z) plugins.
4. Unplug your controller, and plug it in after the boot animation.

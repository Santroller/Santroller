# Using Santroller on Wii / Wii U
The Wii is an interesting case, because different games use different types of instruments.

## Rock Band
Rock Band used USB instruments, so if you set your emulation mode to either `Rock Band Guitar` or `Rock Band Drums`, it will just work out of the box.

## Guitar Hero / DJ Hero
Guitar Hero instruments plugged into the Wii Remote. This means we need to emulate the Wii Extension in some form to play these games.

You can either physically wire a Wii extension port to your controller and plug it into a Wii Remote, or you can mod your Wii and use software to emulate a Wii Extension.

## Adding a Wii extension port to your controller
You can follow the [Wii Extension emulation guide](https://santroller.tangentmc.net/wiring_guides/wii_output.html), and actually emulate proper wii extensions, and then plug them into your remote.

## Emulating a Wii Extension in software
I have written a module that you can use with a USB Loader to play the Guitar Hero, Band Hero and DJ Hero games with a USB instrument, Santroller Brainslug.

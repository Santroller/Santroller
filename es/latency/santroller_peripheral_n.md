# Peripheral

Latency of a digital input sent from another Pi Pico in [peripheral mode](https://santroller.tangentmc.net/wiring_guides/peripheral.html).

Measured by connecting the peripheral to the main Pi Pico, toggling a digital pin on the peripheral, and timing how long it takes that signal to reach a target device over USB from the main Pi Pico.

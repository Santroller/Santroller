# Adding Standard LEDs using the MPR121

If you are using an MPR121 for the slider bar, and wish to hook up LEDs to it and have a few spare channels, you can use it to drive LEDs.

## Supplies

- A guitar with a WT or GH5 slider bar, that has spare channels on the MPR121
- Some LEDs
- The correct current limiting resistor for your specific LEDs

## Steps

1. Connect your LEDs to unused channels on your MPR121. The cathode of each LED connects to ground, while the anodes are all connected to each LED, through a current limiting resistor.

## Programming

1. Click on the output you wish to configure LEDs for, and then click on the channel next to `Selected LEDs on MPR121`

## LED inactivity
You can turn on the `Turn on LEDs after inactivity` setting to have the leds turn completly off after a timer. This is useful if you have leds on `always on` mode, but wish to have your guitar power its LEDs off after it is unused for a given amount of time.

## Mapping a generic gamepad
If your gamepad is not supported, you can map it manually yourself.

1. Click "Add Setting"
2. Find the axis / button you want to assign an input to
3. Set the input type to `USB Host`
4. Pick one of the `generic` inputs. These are the first 16 detected buttons and the main axis that gamepads often bind things to.
5. Calibrate and save, and your mapping should now work.

## Mapping a USB keyboard or mouse

1. Click "Add Setting"
2. Find the axis / button you want to assign an input to
3. Set the input type to `USB Host`
4. Pick `Keyboard Input` or `Mouse Axis` or `Mouse button`
5. Pick the key from the list, or hit `Click to assign` and press a key / move the keyboard / mouse plugged into your PC
6. Save
